| GET       | /photos/{photo}/comments/create | create  | photos.comments.create |
| POST      | /photos/{photo}/comments        | store   | photos.comments.store  |
| GET       | /comments/{comment}             | show    | comments.show          |
| GET       | /comments/{comment}/edit        | edit    | comments.edit          |
| PUT/PATCH | /comments/{comment}             | update  | comments.update        |

### Naming
* files - Capitalize the first letter of each word.
* folders - lowercase.
* properties - any and all properties for objects snake case - this plays better with Redis' hashing.
